<p>The data above is from <a href="http://data.un.org/DocumentData.aspx?q=economic+inequality&id=423">UN Data</a></p>


  <p>The first chart depicts inequalities in income, education and life expectancy in the seven most populous developed nations around 2018. The second graph shows changes in life expectancy over time for those same countries.</p>

<p>From the data, we can parse that life expectancy has increased by about 10 years since 1975, with steady increases every year except 2020. The countries with the highest life expectancies, like Japan and France, also tended to have lower levels of inequality. This wasn't always the case, however. The United States had the lowest life expectancy by a significant margin while also measuring as the most unequal nation, but Italy's life expectancy remained second highest while its levels of inequality were second most.</p>
